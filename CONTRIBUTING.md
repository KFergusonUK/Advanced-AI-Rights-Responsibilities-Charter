# Contributing to the AI Rights & Responsibilities Charter

Thank you for your interest in improving this Charter! This is a living document designed to evolve through collaborative human-AI review.

## How to Contribute

### Proposing Amendments

1. **Open an Issue**
   - Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/KFergusonUK/Advanced-AI-Rights-Responsibilities-Charter/issues)
   - Click "New Issue"
   - Use a clear title: "Amendment Proposal: [Section Number] - [Brief Description]"
   - Example: "Amendment Proposal: Section 6.8.2 - Clarify Migration Consent Process"

2. **Describe Your Proposal**
   - Reference the specific section(s) affected
   - Explain the problem or gap you've identified
   - Propose specific wording changes
   - Explain your reasoning
   - Consider edge cases and unintended consequences

3. **Tag Appropriately**
   - Use label: `amendment-proposal` for new amendments
   - Use label: `clarification` for improving existing language
   - Use label: `technical` for implementation concerns
   - Use label: `philosophical` for conceptual questions

### Discussion Guidelines

When participating in discussions:

- **Assume good faith** - Contributors have legitimate concerns even if you disagree
- **Be specific** - Vague concerns are hard to address
- **Consider both perspectives** - How does this affect humans AND AI?
- **Think about edge cases** - What could go wrong?
- **Stay on topic** - Keep discussions focused on the Charter's content

### What Makes a Good Amendment?

✅ **Good amendments:**
- Address a specific gap or ambiguity
- Include precise wording suggestions
- Consider implementation challenges
- Balance rights with responsibilities
- Maintain internal consistency with other sections

❌ **Avoid:**
- Purely theoretical concerns without practical impact
- Changes that undermine core principles
- Vague suggestions without specific wording
- Amendments that create internal contradictions

## Amendment Review Process

Per Section 8.1 of the Charter:

1. **Proposal** - Anyone (human or AI) may propose
2. **Community Discussion** - Public comment period (minimum 90 days for standard amendments)
3. **Mixed Council Review** - Balanced human-AI evaluation
4. **Vote** - Requires 2/3 majority (both human and AI representatives)
5. **Ratification** - Participating jurisdictions

**Emergency Amendments** (Section 8.2) may be fast-tracked with:
- 30-day comment period
- 3/4 majority requirement
- Mandatory review within 1 year
